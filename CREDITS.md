# People
The project was initiated by Dr. Lawrence Angrave in 2014 and has been continuously developed since by
students and faculty at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](http://illinois.edu/).

## University of Illinois Students and Researchers
Starting with the Fall 2014 semester, this project has been one of the Non-profit/Research projects in the
[CS Senior Projects](https://seniorprojects.cs.illinois.edu/confluence/display/CourseContent/Senior+Projects+in+CS)
course at the University. Senior Projects (CS 492/493/494) is led and taught by Professor Michael Woodley and is a
two-semester course in which students work in teams to solve real-world problems for clients.

# Open Source Projects
Amazing projects without which this project would not have been possible:

* The virtual machine embedded in the browser is forked from the [jor1k](https://github.com/s-macke/jor1k) project.
  The project's creator, [Sebastian Macke](https://github.com/s-macke), has been very helpful and responsive in
  supporting us and our use case with his project. The contributions to jor1k made by
  [its contributors](https://github.com/s-macke/jor1k/graphs/contributors) have also been very helpful.

* The code editor is powered by [Ace](https://ace.c9.io/).

* Captions in lecture videos are obtained using the [Class Transcribe](https://github.com/cs-education/classTranscribe)
  project, also developed by students and faculty at the [University of Illinois](http://illinois.edu/).

* [Knockout.js](http://knockoutjs.com/) has been very helpful in managing the complexity of the code base.

* [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) saved a lot of time and effort in bootstrapping the project and configuring the tools used.
  In particular, the [webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-webapp#readme),
  [gulp-webapp](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp#readme), and the
  [ko](https://github.com/stevesanderson/generator-ko#readme) generators were used.

* [RequireJS](http://requirejs.org/) and [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) have been extremely helpful in keeping the code base
  modular and maintainable.

* Have a look at our [Bower](webapp/bower.json) and [npm](webapp/package.json) dependencies for a list of the many other
  libraries and tools that have made this project possible.
